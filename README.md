BBC Java Spring REST MVC Service Layer Application

This is a beta of a simple(ish) CMS that is used to populate the BBC's Music [Showcase](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/showcase).

This was a massive learning experience, utilising the BBC's developer community and their huge project codebase.

It was sandbox development, using maven.

The major advantage to me was getting to grips to with simple, lightweight Spring MVC RESTful architecture.
This service layer just passes JSON up and down the stack

Another (dis)advantage was my first attempt at Hibernate. I had mixed feelings on this project re Hibernate. 
I come from a RDMS background and can write optimised SQL in my sleep but when it came to implementing a many-to-many hibernate 
domain model i hit a wall.
I eventually got there, but it wasn't until a later hibernate project that I started to fully grasp it.
